# wokwi-rp2040-rust-demos
[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) supports emulating RP2040, but it doesn't emulate the hardware well enough to run most Rust code.  
This is bunch of Rust projects tested locally on real hardware, to use for improving wokwi's RP2040 support

## Working
- spi-blocking-sdcard

## Partially working
- i2c-blocking-ssd1306 (only at opt-level 0)

## Not Working
